# üéì Faculty Management API

This module handles **Faculty creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion** within the AFUED Result Processing Package.  
It ensures only authenticated users (and specifically admins) can modify faculties, while normal users can view them.

## üß† Notes

* `req.user` is assumed to be injected by the authentication middleware (`authenticateUser`).
* All responses are handled using the custom utility `buildResponse(res, status, message, data, isError, errorDetails?)`.
* The faculty model should include at least:

  ```js
  {
    name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    createdBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }
  }
  ```
* Make sure to import the routes into your main `app.js` like so:

  ```js
  import facultyRoutes from "./modules/faculty/faculty.routes.js";
  app.use("/api/faculties", facultyRoutes);
  ```
